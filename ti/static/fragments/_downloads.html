<h2>Platform Distribution</h2>
<p>
The full MCT platform distribution is now available for download to your computer. You must configure it for your installation before you run it for the first time.  The downloadable framework is exactly that â€“ a framework on which you will put the user objects, data feeds, views, etc. that are applicable to your environment and needs. Unlike the evaluation version, it does not contain any preloaded telemetry objects, collections, or compositions, since you will create or import the MCT objects that you need and combine them into customized collections and compositions.
