<h1>Start experiencing Open MCT today</h1>
<p>
Download and experiment with the evaluation demo that includes preloaded objects, an embedded database, a selection of views, and a simulated data feed. If you haven't viewed our <a href="https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/OpenMCT/whatis/">overview video</a> yet, we encourage you to do so - it's the best way to get familiar with MCT's capabilities and features.

<h3>Installation and Startup</h3>
<ol>

<li>Uncompress the .zip file that was just downloaded. In most operating systems, this is accomplished by simply double-clicking the .zip file.</li>
<li>Navigate inside the extracted folder named "mct-demo-1.8" and double-click the file named "MCT.jar" Alternately, from the command line you can navigate within the extracted folder and run this command: <code>java -jar MCT.jar</code></li>
<li>The Open MCT evaluation demo should now start and run.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Platform Distribution</h2>
<p>
The full MCT platform distribution is now available for download to your computer. You must configure it for your installation before you run it for the first time.  The downloadable framework is exactly that â€“ a framework on which you will put the user objects, data feeds, views, etc. that are applicable to your environment and needs. Unlike the evaluation version, it does not contain any preloaded telemetry objects, collections, or compositions, since you will create or import the MCT objects that you need and combine them into customized collections and compositions.
