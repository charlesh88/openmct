# If you prefer the indented syntax, you might want to regenerate this
# project again passing --syntax sass, or you can uncomment this:

# and then run:
# sass-convert -R --from scss --to sass vfn_platform/static/sass scss && rm -rf sass && mv scss sass

# Production, run this:
# compass compile -e production --force
